# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer
The function `print double` is being called by using the (parenthesis), so its being invoked. This would be a type error. 

To call the function `print double`, you can remove the parenthesis and it will run!
