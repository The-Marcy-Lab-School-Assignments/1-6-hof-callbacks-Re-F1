An inline function is one that is defined, but not initialized or declared, directly in the code where it is needed or within the context of where it is used. It is also called an anonymous function because it is not given a name when defined.

We use them often for callback functions or when we want to immediately execute something. An example would be using an inline function within a method and logging it to the console:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.forEach((num) => console.log(num)); //1, 2, 3
```
